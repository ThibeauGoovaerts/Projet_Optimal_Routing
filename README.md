# Bungalow Park Optimization System

## Project Overview

In my first client project, I showcased not just technical skills but a holistic approach to project management with the **Bungalow Park Optimization System**. This system, powered by a Python-based local application, connected to a Cloud MySQL database through a dynamic JavaScript API and a user-friendly web application. The project aimed to tackle the challenge of optimizing cleaning routes in a picturesque bungalow park.

## Key Features

- **Optimal Pathfinding Algorithm:** At the core of the system lies an algorithm using Google ORTools and my custom logic. This algorithm dynamically adapts to the changing landscape of the bungalow park, ensuring flexibility in task division and route optimization.

- **Cloud-Connected MySQL Database:** The backbone of the system is a cloud-hosted MySQL database, ensuring real-time data management and accessibility, facilitating seamless communication among diverse park services.

- **Service Integration:** The system weaves together various park services, connecting reception, cleaning, technical support, and accounting. This integration fosters efficient communication channels for holistic park management.

- **Web Application for Communication:** Crafted with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, the client web application empowers users to report deposits, technical issues, and access historical records, embodying the spirit of custom solutions tailored to user needs.

- **AWS and Combell Deployment:** The decision to deploy the system on AWS and Combell reflects a commitment to scalable, reliable, and secure cloud solutions.

- **On-Premises Infrastructure:** To meet specific security and performance requirements, I implemented an on-premises infrastructure, offering clients flexible deployment options.

## Analysis and Client Interaction

From inception to implementation, I took charge of the entire analysis process. Client meetings were focused on understanding the unique challenges of the bungalow park. On-premises testing with end-users allowed me to fine-tune solutions based on real-world scenarios. My commitment to preemptive problem-solving led to testing out different solutions on-premises before final implementation, ensuring a seamless and tailored solution.
